An extremely cursed and terrible text to image AI which uses the [internet parrots model](https://github.com/self-distilled-stylegan/self-distilled-internet-photos#additional-pre-trained-models) from [Self-Distilled StyleGAN](https://self-distilled-stylegan.github.io/) on [Peter Baylies' projector_clip.py](https://gist.github.com/pbaylies/671ef8434fd11f056bab4330e0e7c365) to generate terrifying parrot abominations.
